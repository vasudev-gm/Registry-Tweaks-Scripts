# Registry-Tweaks-Scripts
Contains registry tweaks and simple batch scripts

I will basically divide it into 2 directories/sections called cmds and reg_tweaks which I commonly use when creating custom up-to-date windows 10 ISO using WinToolkit,NTLite and W10UI. I will include direct links for directx9, netfx35 and vc++ runtimes repacks etc.

Thank you abbodi1406, Majorgeek, WinAero for reg tweaks, repacks and scripts.
